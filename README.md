# Flight Summary Generator

A console program that generates and outputs flight summary data.
Making use of SOLID Formatting principles.

- While launching the Console Program, the user is prompted to add a Valid Filename for the InputFile.
- After the Summary of the File has been generated, the "FlightSummary.txt" is generated under 
  the Windows Explorer "Documents" Folder.

### Possible Improvements and Enhancements

- Further validations for the inputfile values can be added through Dependency Injection of FlightSummaryValidator.
- More Extensive Tests can be added to validate handling of null or invalid values for the Passenger entities.
